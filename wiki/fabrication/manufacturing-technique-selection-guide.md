## Laser Cutting Guide
This link is to both an introductory and advanced topic laser cutting guide that seeks to answers all your laser cutting questions. The guide starts off by giving a brief history of lasers to the common laser cutting machines of today. Multiple diagrams explaining how a typical laser cutter works are provided that really help the reader understand what is physically going on when their design is cut. The guide also provides an in-depth set of guidelines for creating both laser cutter specific parts, like living hinges, as well as general rules for cutting basic mechanical devices like intermeshing gears.

## Stereolithography Guide
This page provides an in-depth guide to rapid prototyping with Stereolithography (SLA) 3d printing. This guide begins with a brief history of this additive manufacturing process, that quickly transitions into current SLA technologies on the market today. The guide also explains the difference between right side up SLA devices and inverted SLA devices, providing the benefits and costs of each when it comes to print quality and resolution. This site also provides a comparison of different resins and their material properties, as well as how different orientations impact the prints mechanical properties.  This helpful for it can aid design choices for 3d printed parts that may be included in high stress or high cycle environments, because tolerances and mechanical properties matter here.

## CNC Machining Guide
This guide provides a list of best design practices when creating a part to be custom machined in a CNC mill. One of the practices it lists is understanding and managing tolerances. While every designer would like to have their part be exactly as they designed it, this guide explains the cost of adding thigh tolerances to a part that might not be completely necessary. This guide is a great tool for any designer or engineer, because it makes its recommendations based on one of the most important things in industry, costs. Information regarding best CNC design practices, as they relate to lead time and cost, is very useful, as it can prepare an individual best for making design decisions that will allow their product to flourish on the market.

## Selecting a Rapid Prototyping Process
This guide contains a great set of information on choosing the best rapid prototyping process for your design based on their individual specifications. One of the most helpful pieces of information this page as to offer is a huge chart containing prototyping processes from Stereolithography and Selective laser sintering to Injection Molding and CNCing. While it does a great job comparing the different methods based on strength, finish and possible use material, it does a better job going in-depth on each process to create a detailed guide to inform any new designer or engineer about the different rapid prototyping processes out there to help them create systems and components more informed and well-tailored to an application.
