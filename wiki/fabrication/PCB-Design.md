This article talks about Printed Circuit Board Designing for Electronics Subsystems

## Why?

Creating a robust, error-free electronics solution is as important as making it work. Reliability of an electronic circuit in a mechanically disturbed environment (i.e. Robotâ€™s body) can be a key concern. Hence designing a PCB is a great idea to secure all the electronics connections. It helps in refining an electronic design with all bypass options and creates a fixed number of features for design. With growing complexity one can design a better circuit with industrial standards like trace width, ground planes for heat dissipation etc. in place.

## How?

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AXwjZoyNno) tutorial is a great place to start on PCB designing in EAGLE CAD software.

The typical workflow of a PCB Design is as follows:
- Planning
- Component Design/Library Sourcing
- Schematic
- Board Layout
- Design Rule Check
- Gerber Production

[This](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjPWeOcXkMIOA_bd4LbivGg) channel provides all the basics of PCB Designing.

## When?

PCB Design is important for long term reliability of the project. However it is important to figure out at what point in the project should this task be done. A ball park estimate is when the basic features are figured out and all the submodules tested indivudally, this is when the PCB Design can begin so that time is not wasted on just designing and redesigning the PCB based on additional features. One must ensure that the PCB is only finalized when all the submodules are tested together as an integrated system on breadboard. 

## Summary

In this wiki we talked about why we need a PCB in our robotics system, how we can make a PCB and discussed about the typical workflow of a PCB Design Sprint. We also looked at the ideal timeline on when to start designing the PCB.
