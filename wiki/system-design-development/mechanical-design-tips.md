## Summary
Mechanisms for Conversion of Rotary Motion - Link 1

This paper dives into the many mechanisms that exist to translate rotary motion from a motor to alternate forms of motions. Oftentimes, electromechanical systems require motion that cannot be directly provided with just a rotary motor. A variety of mechanisms exist to translate the torque and motion from a rotary motor to an alternate motion, such as linear motion, interrupted rotation, and rotary oscillation. This link serves as an extensive list for such mechanisms, and it serves useful to give users an idea of different ways they can utilize their actuators to perform specific motion. Not only does the paper give a description of how the mechanism works, but it also provides videos to enhance understanding.

Working with Large Assemblies in CAD - Link 2

A common part of designing any mechatronic system is developing a computer aided design model to represent the system in a virtual 3D space. Often, even the most complicated robots have a CAD assembly with a model for every single part, down to the nuts and bolts. This is extremely useful for engineers to visualize their design in a 3D space, but many parts in an assembly can lead to complications, such as slow runtime, propagation of error among components, and over-definition due to poor or conflicting mates. This tutorial gives useful tips for how to put together an assembly with robustness in mind, eliminating potential errors that could cause the engineer heartache once they get far into their CAD assembly.

Design for Manufacture and Assembly - Link 3

This slideshow gives a great broad overview to DFMA, providing definitions, examples, and tips for successful designing for manufacturing and assembly. Designing for manufacturing and assembly becomes critical when a system makes it transition from prototype to mass-manufacturable design. Even in a single prototype, designing for manufacturing and assembly greatly simplifies the prototyping and assembly of the device, allowing the engineer to get the design right the first time they manufacture it. By walking through this presentation, a reader can gain an understanding of the thinking behind DFMA and how to apply it to their projects.

Material and Process Selection - Link 4

This page provides a comprehensive set of charts, equations, and guidelines for selecting materials for a given application. Material selection is critical in mechanical design, as the properties of a material greatly affect its performance in whatever application it is in. This page can be useful for engineers who understand what sort of properties they desire for their part, such as high Youngâ€™s modulus or low coefficient of friction. It plots data points for a variety of materials on a graph comparing useful parameters, such as tensile strength against relative cost, to give the user quantifiable data for selecting a material. In addition to this, the page provides useful charts for selecting a manufacturing process, such as the process tolerance chart or the process material matrix. These charts give an idea of what processes pair best with things like part material, section thickness, mass, tolerance, and surface roughness. These are all important considerations when selecting a manufacturing process, and thus this section is useful for the engineer looking to choose a manufacturing process for their application. 

Fits and Tolerances - Link 5

Designing a proper connection between parts is critical in electromechanical systems, particularly complicated ones in which an issue in one connection can translate to other issues in the system. A common type of connection between components is through pinning or bolting. These methods require designing parts with specific hole sizes in order to produce a desired fit. Slight variations in hole size can cause a loose fit to become a press fit or vice versa, vastly changing the functionality of a connection. This page walks through the different types of fits and applications for them, and then provides tables of actual values to design around when making different types of fits.
