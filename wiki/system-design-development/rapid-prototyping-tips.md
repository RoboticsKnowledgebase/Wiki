## Summary
Saving Time, Money, and Material with Laser Cutting

This article instructs a reader how to make the most out of their funds when laser cutting. L cutting can allow an engineer to rapidly prototype their design in order to validate its functionality. However, this rapid process often causes engineers to be somewhat careless in their designing and manufacturing, as they have the feeling that they can easily change and manufacture their design. However, this security often leads to wasted time and material, as well as less than ideal prototypes. This article provides tips and tricks for getting the design right the first time, without wasting often expensive material such as acrylic or plywood.

Designing for 3D Printing

3D printing provides another outstanding method for quickly manufacturing parts and validating a design. However, despite the belief of many, you canâ€™t 3D print anything. The technology in its current state has limitations, and thus, engineers need to take care when utilizing 3D printing to make a part. This link gives a nice general overview of how to design a part with 3D printing in mind, so that the print will not fail and the part will come out as desired.

3D Printing Methods

This guide walks through all the current different types of 3D printers. These include stereolithography (SLA), digital light processing (DLP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), selective laser melting (SLM), electronic beam melting (EBM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), binder jetting (BJ), and material jetting (MJ). It talks about how each process works, the materials it utilizes, and the costs and benefits it has when compared to other processes. This article proves useful for someone looking to 3D print a part, but not sure what process they want to use for their application.
