## Summary
DC Motor Selection - Link 1

DC motors are a critical component in many electromechanical systems, as they provide continuous rotary motion which can be turned into a wide variety of other motions. However, there is a massive range of applications for DC motors, each with varying requirements. This page provides a tutorial as well as an online page to guide the user in selecting their actuators. Given the basic parameters such as speed and torque, along with other characteristics like voltage, current, gearbox, and efficiency, the site provides catalogs of motors that meet the specs the user requires.

Gearbox Selection - Link 2

Gearboxes are useful in adjusting speed and torque outputs from motors for specific applications. Additionally, gearboxes often determine how an actuator will be mounted, an important consideration when assembling an electromechanical system. This page defines important gearbox characteristics, and then describes how a reader should go about selecting a gearbox with desirable characteristics for their application.

Servo Selection - Link 3

Servos are some of the most simple actuators to implement into an electromechanical system, making them very common among a variety of different robots. However, selecting a servo with proper parameters for a given application is critical; poor servo selection can lead to inaccuracy, difficulty of tuning, or lack of speed. This article goes through a pretty basic overview of the steps required to select a proper servo, allowing a reader to obtain parameters for the actuator that they need to purchase for their system.

Battery Selection - Link 4

This article dives into the different types of batteries that exist, their tradeoffs, and considerations when selecting between them. This article proves useful when the engineer already has a general idea of what sort of power source they might need. It provides an in-depth comparison of common battery types such as lead acid, nickel cadmium, nickel metal hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, and lithium iron phosphate. This helps a reader to get an idea of what sort of battery would be best for their system given their constraints.
