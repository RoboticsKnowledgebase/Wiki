## Motor Selection Summary
This link provides a wealth of information to aid in motor selection for a given project. It gives a basic overview of most of the different types of AC and DC motors, along with their respective costs and benefits. This link is a good place to start if someone does not know what motor to select for their project. It also is helpful because it not only tells of the performance differences between motors, it also explains the physical difference between motor types.

## Battery Selection Summary 
This link is a great page to read if you want to get not only a basic understanding of lipo batteries, it is also a great site to reach if you need help in choosing a battery for a cordless project. This site spells out the different benefits of lipo and nimh batteries, as well as giving a break down of what each symbol and number means on a battery pack. For example, the link will teach you what 50C 5000mAh means and gives you helpful equations to see if a battery can supply the voltage and current your setup needs.

## Material Selection Summary
This page outlines a basic set of question an engineer or designer needs to ask them when choosing the materials to make their design out of. One important tip that this site provides is not to just design a process or mechanism first and choose materials for that design after it is made, it recommends that specific designs should be created with a material, or material class in mind. Beyond this, it also provides the basic of some tooling processes and how they impact material properties. This link is important for any design engineer, as it gives them a new set of considerations to take into account when choosing a material for a component.

## Hardware Selection
Including information on bolts, nuts, oil seals, wiper rings, belts, bearings and more, this page is a great place for any engineer or designer to reference if they need information on different classifications of hardware. Taking bearings for example, this site provides basic information on what makes up a typical bearing, as well as advanced facts on bearing hydrodynamics. This page is a great place for both basic and advanced info on all things hardware, making a link for anyone who has to make hardware decisions on a project or design.

## End Effector Selection
While it might seem like an article only useful for teams working on the shipbot problem, this article also provides useful information that our group could use for our vacuum cup adhesion method, as it delves into vacuum griper benefits and roadblocks as well as more typical end effectors pros and cons. Although a great deal of this page is dedicated to end effectors in an industrial application, its information is still very useful to a designer or engineer in charge of how a robotic system directly interacts with its environment and task because of its great deal of detail in how each end effector class operates.
