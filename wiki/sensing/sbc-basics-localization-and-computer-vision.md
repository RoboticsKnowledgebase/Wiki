## SBC Basics Summary
This site provides a basic over view of the ins and outs of single board computers. While the information contained on this site may seem basic to a skilled electrical engineer, for more mechanically minded individuals this page provides a great introduction and explanation to single board computers that can be used to control many different motors or solenoids. The site starts with the basics, like what are sbc and why do we need them and continues on to more focused area like explaining the specifications of a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBoard. This focused attention to real products helps bring sbc theory to a more concrete application.

## Single Board Computer (SBC) Computer Vision:
A very important aspect of the shipbot design challenge is interfacing computer vision with end effector manipulation and choosing a SBC to best allow for this communication is key. This link can help by listing and explaining the benefits of different SBCs with embedded computer vision. This site also compares deep learning and traditional computer vision, explaining how each is able to deal with real world noise and variations not accounted for. Another important mention of this article is its consideration of community support. Computer vision is a difficult task to master and help from others who have done it successfully is important, so when this article mentions the best communities for help, it provides great information that can help inform an engineer’s choice of SBC for their computer vision problem.

## Sensor Localization on Robot:
This paper is based around the development of a robot tour guide that is set to be used in museums. Although it may not seem to directly relate to any of the design projects in this course, localization through various sensors has actually been a very important part of all the course’s robots. The paper’s robot, Doris, uses multiple different sensors, including laser range finders, and RFID system, and an omni directional camera to properly localize. This use of multiple different sensor types working in tandem to ensure a robot is where it needs to is an important layer of redundancy that should ideally be applied to any robot where knowing one’s location is paramount.
